# Aim-Trainer
This is an aim trainer I made just to practice.
All the work is my own except for the randNum formula on js:38. I copied this from a snake game tutorial I did from Bro Code on YT.

I am perticulary proud of js:64. this reduces the accuracy needed to score a hit and took me a good 2 hours to figure out lol.

I will be trying to learn how to add an image to the target, an image to the board background, some sound effects, and a small flash image to indicate a hit.

I was trying to create a condition if((hits + misses) == 30), so that I could end the game and display an evaluation of the players results. I couldn't get that working. I have been working on this folder for around 8 hours straight and neede to take a break.

If you do happen to see this repo and could be kind enough to add to it, I would be very gratefull! 

Thank you if you took the time to read this!
